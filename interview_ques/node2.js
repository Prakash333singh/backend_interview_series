///what is cookie??

// A cookie is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser stores this data and sends it back to the server with future requests to the same server. Cookies are used for various purposes, such as:

// Session Management: Keeping users logged in as they navigate a site.
// Personalization: Storing user preferences and settings.
// Tracking: Collecting data on user behavior for analytics or advertising.
// What is cookie-parser?
// In lame terms, cookie-parser is a tool that helps web servers understand and work with cookies more easily. When a user visits a website, the server sends cookies, which the user's browser saves. When the user comes back to the site, the browser sends these cookies back to the server.

// How cookie-parser Works
// Reads Cookies: When a user sends a request to the server (like when they load a webpage), cookie-parser looks at the cookies sent with the request.
// Makes Cookies Accessible: It takes these cookies and makes them available in an easy-to-use format for the server. You can then use these cookies in your code without having to manually decode them.
// Example in Simple
